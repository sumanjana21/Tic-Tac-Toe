# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe, often called Noughts and Crosses, is a timeless game known for its simplicity and strategic depth. Played on a 3x3 grid, two players take turns marking empty spaces with their respective symbols—commonly "X" and "O." The goal is straightforward: align three of your symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—while blocking your opponent from doing the same.
